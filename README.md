#Spam classifier using NLP
#Description:
The Spam Classifier Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a machine learning project designed to automatically categorize and filter out spam messages from a given dataset. This project leverages NLP techniques to analyze the textual content of messages and make predictions about their spam or non-spam nature.
#Key Components and Features:

Data Collection: The project begins with the collection of a diverse dataset comprising both spam and non-spam (ham) messages. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the classifier.

Text Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standardize the textual data. This includes tasks such as tokenization, stemming or lemmatization, and removing stop words and special characters.

Feature Extraction: NLP features are extracted from the preprocessed text, which may include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors, word embeddings, or other relevant features.

Model Selection: Various machine learning models are evaluated for their effectiveness in classifying spam messages. Commonly used models for this task include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers.

Training: The chosen model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using labeled examples. The model learns to recognize patterns and characteristics that distinguish spam from non-spam messages.

Evaluation: The performance of the spam classifier is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation dataset. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in identifying spam while minimizing false positives (legitimate messages classified as spam).
